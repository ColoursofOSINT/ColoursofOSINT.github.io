# Thoughts on Recommended Extensions
My findings about the Recommended Extensions in Firefox is that the program is good in theory, but has serious flaws in execution. The program appears to have lax examination procedures and ineffective policies which provide a false sense of security for Firefox users. 

## Policy Problems

1. No requirement to allow examination of source code
2. No 
## Extension Examination Failures
## Communication Failures 

# Afterword
Overall, I'm disappointed in Mozilla. Not so much for the failures to catch remote code and hidden analytics, but rather the willing misrepresentation of the security the certification provides. It's certainly not as bad as the 'Featured' extensions on Chrome, but I expected better. While the vast majority of the Recommended Extensions I looked into were privacy and security respecting, this is more likely to be a result of the open source community keeping extensions honest. The abject failure to catch even the most obvious of violations does not inspire confidence.
