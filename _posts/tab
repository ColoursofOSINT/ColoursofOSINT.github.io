![Developer Excuses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColoursofOSINT/ColoursofOSINT.github.io/6faf08296b6555ec0817598bf0bf68b9f4a31635/assets/img/images/Lmao.png)

One of the most interesting pieces of code that I stumbled across sent out a request for "developer excuses".

```
;(async function (e, t) {
  e.push();
  const n =
    t === 'developerexcuses'
      ? await (async function () {
          try {
            const response = await fetch('https://api.tabliss.io/v1/developer-excuses');
            return { quote: (await response.json()).data };
          } catch (error) {
            return { quote: 'Unable to get a new developer excuse.' };
          }
        })()
      : undefined; //
})();
```
The API for Tabliss randomly returns excuses, with such gems as:

1. "I have too many other high priority things to do right now"
2. "That code seemed so simple I didn't think it needed testing"
3. "Our redundant systems must have failed as well"

Even more interesting was the site it request the excuses from "tabliss.io". This is the homepage for the Tabliss extension, which is also a recommended extension.[^footnote3] Not only that, it was also mentioned as an extension that violated the Firefox standards by Krono in the post that inspired this investigation.[^footnote4]

I have examined Tabliss Extension, but found no violations or unexpected functions hidden within.
